# BetterLeads

A mod that allows you to use leads on more entities as well as chain leashes.

Currently, works with Merchant Entities (Villagers and Wandering Traders), most Hostile Mobs, Water Creatures (fish and
squid), turtles and pandas, you can configure which of these categories are enabled through ModMenu.

The Mobs which it doesn't work properly with are:

- Phantoms
- Ghasts
- Slimes
- Magma-cubes
- Shulkers
- Vexs
- and Bats

To chain leashes between entities leash an entity as normal then click on entity you want to leash it to whilst 
sneaking, this feature is disabled by default. Leashes connecting entities do not persist across reloads and may be a
bit buggy.
